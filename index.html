Documentation:
Early in the process, our group had a meeting on Zoom to plan this assignment. The responsibilities were quite easily distributed, as a couple group members volunteered for doing the coding, and the rest agreed on being responsible for the documentation. We also selected a project leader by suggesting one of the group members, and that person said that he did not mind being the leader. We had no difficulties distributing responsibilities, which was a pleasure. The members who were going to code, wanted to try this on their own in the beginning, then show us later to have some examples. We all did some research online to get a general idea of what frugal innovation is, which was important in order to build a relevant website on the subject. Further on, we shared screens in order to see the actual coding. In this way, we all could give advice and agree on certain aspects together. Live coding can have its difficulties, but by looking at the coders’ screen, we were able to both partake and learn more. We had the possibility of commenting and helping each other out.

We all suggested ideas about how we wanted the website to look like. Every member worked on information about the staff members of the company, gave ideas on what could stand under company information, etc. We used Google docs in order to see each others’ examples, and to be able to change or correct things as well. This is a method we found that worked for us, and everyone was able to contribute insight. We had several digital meetings via Zoom in order to do some work little by little. This way, we could also look at the project with fresher eyes the next time and see if certain things needed to be worked on or changed. We went for a minimalistic design and layout with few colors as well as not too many differences in fonts, font sizes etc. We felt as though this fit well with the purpose of frugal innovation and what it stands for. We are pleased with how the website turned out. It was also easy to cooperate with each other, and we found it rather nice to do this project together.
